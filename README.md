# Chipper

There are a lot of CHIP-8 and SCHIP emulators, but I believe this is the first one developed in HTML5 and JavaScript (originally published in 2011).

Every game I tested worked ok, and I think the performance is nice, at least using the latest browsers.

The main purpose of the project is showing the basics of emulation, so playing with the code is highly encouraged!
