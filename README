Chipper
-------

There are a lot of CHIP8 and SCHIP emulators, but I believe this is the first one developed in HTML5 and JavaScript.

Every game I tested worked ok, and I think the performance is nice, at least using the latest browsers suporting HTML5 on a recent computer.

The main purpose of the proyect is showing the basics of emulation, so playing with the code is really encouraged :D
